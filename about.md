# Auto Group Options
This mod allows you to set default extras options for place objects. These defaults are <cg>per-level</c>,
meaning each level can have their own defaults. This mod simply creates an invisible camera trigger at (0, -500) in the
editor, <cj>allowing these defaults to be saved and used across computers</c>.

The button to select defaults can be found in the level settings menu. All options <cr>(except "hide")</c> in the extras
menu are supported.
